### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastapi-ai-sdk.git
cd fastapi-ai-sdk
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=fastapi_ai_sdk --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_stream"
```

### Code Quality

Before submitting, ensure your code passes all quality checks:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black fastapi_ai_sdk tests examples

# Sort imports with isort
isort fastapi_ai_sdk tests examples

# Lint with flake8
flake8 fastapi_ai_sdk tests examples

# Type check with mypy
mypy fastapi_ai_sdk
```

### Building Documentation

If you're updating documentation:

```bash
# Install documentation dependencies
pip install -e ".[docs]"

# Build docs
cd docs
make html
```

## Style Guide

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting (line length: 88)
- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- Add type hints for all public functions
- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```
Add support for custom event types

- Implement DataEvent.create() factory method
- Add validation for event type prefixes
- Update tests to cover new functionality

Fixes #123
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or increase code coverage
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests in classes

Example:

```python
class TestAIStreamBuilder:
    def test_text_method_adds_three_events(self):
        """Test that text() method adds start, delta, and end events."""
        # Test implementation
```
